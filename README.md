The purpose of this project is to understand the relationships/trends between population and real estate sale prices. In this study, the team will analyze real estate data from Zillow and population data from Census Bureau to to derive insights. The questions will attempt to answer the following quesitons:

1. Which towns & states have grown the fastest in home value in past decade?
2. Does personal income keep pace with the growth in property values?
3. How does the population change in towns with higher home values? (i.e. Does property values lead or lag behind population growth?)
