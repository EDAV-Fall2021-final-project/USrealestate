This study will work towards uncovering the insights &amp; relationships between unemployment, income, population, and housing units to determine if/how these variables drive home prices across the country. The team chose to investigate this topic because affordable housing is one of the most important human needs. In addition to the basic need of shelter, affordable housing provides opportunities for schooling, for work, for economic activities, and for better urban planning. Residents can gain access to better schooling systems and work opportunities. Businesses can better flourish within communities with higher purchasing power. Communities can become more diverse and vibrant. Furthermore, home purchase is one of the biggest financial decisions that a family can make. It’s an asset purchase that typically sticks with the buyer between 15-30 years. Most buyers spend between 25-40% of net worth on real estate purchases. Given the importance of home values to our everyday lives, we want to use the data to better understand the economic trends of society and the real estate market by answering but not limited to the following key questions: How has home values changed over time across 50 States? Is there a relationship between home value and income/unemployment? Is there a relationship between home value and population change? Etc.

The Census datasets that we are referencing contains information such as income, population, unemployment, and housing unit. These datssets come from the government organization and are mostly complete. However, on the other hand, the home value data from Zillow, which contains 10 years of price data across 900 distinct cities in US, are missing many data points. By plotting the Zillow Data using the missing value plot, we notice that year 2010 has the maximum number of missing values of ‘homevalue’, and the number of missing values decreases gradually over the years. To supplement these missing values, we perform an imputation for our missing value Since our data is time series of home value from year 2010 to year 2019, we applied the Time-series Specific method. The time series method of imputation assume the adjacent observations will be similar to the missing data. These assumpetions work well for price over time as each data point would be similar to its temporal neighbors.

The most obvious way is to determine whether there’s any correlations exist between home value, population, housing unit, unemployment, and income. This can be achieve through a correlation matrix, pairs plot, parallel coordinates chart. In the correlation matrix above, it is most obvious that there is a strong correlation between population and housing unit over the years. This should be natural in normal functioning society with low number of homelessness. However, there doesn’t seem to be any correlation between population and housing unit, which is interesting because this suggests that increasing population did not put upward pressure towards home values. Again, this can indiate that the home building market is efficient and is keeping up with population thus relieving any potential pent up demand. The second interesting observation here is the correlation (0.62) between income and home value. This suggests that increase in income in a State is also linked to increasing home values. Delving deeper, unemployment rate is negatively correlated (-0.52) to income but has little to no correlation (-0.18) to home values. This is interesting because perhaps income is a bridging variable that connect unemployment to home values. These results confirm this by viewing in a different perspective via parallel coordinates chart. By graphing the parallel coordinates plot and faceting over the years, the results confirm the relationships between unemployment rate, income, and home value. Furthermore, it provides insights into how it changes over time. The results suggest that following the 2008 recession unemployment rate steadily declined which lead to a increase income and then lead to an increase in home value in some states. It also confirms that population and housing unit are coorelated with each other but have no correlations with other variables. 5.2 Visualizing the known relationships After discovering the relationships between unemployment rate, income, and home value, we can extrapolate further by visualizing relationships between these variables in different perspectives. Reviewing the distribution between those 3 variables, the economic trends becomes much more apparent. First, focusing on unemployment rates vs income, following the financial crisis in 2010, unemployment rate across U.S. has a huge variance between 4% to 13%. During this year and the subsequent years, wages were capped between $40k to $80k. It wasn’t until unemployment rate was under control and below 7.5% that wages collectively increased. Now that we understand unemployment rate is a prerequisite for rising income, we can focus on income vs home values. Throughout the years, it can be observed that rising income leads to more expensive home prices. In fact, a wider range in income actually leads to a wider distribution of home value prices. In the beginning of the decade when income was much less distributed, home values across states also had less variance and was clustered under $200k per home. However, towards the end of the decade in 2019, home values &amp; and income became significantly more distributed. 5.3 Observing key variables across geographies Now that these relationships are better understood, let’s explore how these trends shift and compare across different geographies. We will first look at unemployment rate over the past decade. From our observations of the choropleth heat map over time, West &amp; South East had the most severe unemployment rate in 2010. The recovery in the 9 years since then is significant. States like Nevada and California bridged 5-7% differences. It is notable because California had one of the highest unemployment rates but now commands some of the highest home prices in the U.S. Taking a closer look in the unemployment landscape of 2010, the results are remarkable given the current state of employment rates &amp; home values. Notable states that had the highest unemployment rates amongst States are Nevada, Michigan, California, and Florida. As we review Income &amp; Home Value, it will be more apparent that these States are notable because of their dramatic recovery. As unemployment rate improved, the states that had the worst unemployment rates actually turned to have the highest incomes or neighbor states that have the highest income. Noted form before, home values typically follow income. The states that developed the highest income also developed comparatively higher home prices. However, looking at the map, there’s another notable trend that can be observed. Despite having some of the highest income in US, the home prices in the Northeastern part of the country did not rise as dramatically as the Western part of the US. There’s not enough data to conclusively understand why; perhaps we can augment the analysis in the future with weather data, sentiments, etc. to better understand. Lastly, by graphic Income vs Home Value for each of the State, we can validate our findings with a trend a line and Rsquared values. We can confirm that the notable Western States (e.g. CA &amp; NV) have a steeper slope when compared to the rest of the States; this supports our theory that it has the fastest growth in income and home value prices over the last decade. We can also confirm that select Northeastern States have an increase in income but home value has not grown comparatively (e.g. NJ &amp; CT) 5.4 Price comparison of Home Value Finally, to conclude this study, we will further investigate home value to better understand the specifics of how it changes for each State over the years. Through understanding the price dynamics across the market, we can perhaps help buyers/readers understand the history and navigate purchasing decisions. From the above Cleveland Dot Plot, it is apparent that the most expensive States continued to be the most expensive. The markets that are hottest actually had the biggest price increases from the past decade and increased prices in multiples while cheaper markets only have modest gains (e.g. HI, CA, etc.) It is notable that most States have the highest value in the most recent year of 2019 with a few exceptions: Rhode Island &amp; New Jersey. Next, we can divide the geography into the 4 major regions in US. Looking at the distributions, here are the main insights: The order of descending median home values are as follows: West, NorthEast, South, and MidWest. West has the most amount outliers on the bottom range and top range. Although South has a lower median than Northeast, the most expensive outliers are more expensive than most of Northeast. Northeast distribution of prices have remained relatively stable throughout the decade. Midwest has the cheapest real estate and also the most narrow distribution As a final statement in this study, we also want to learn whether the growth in income have kept pace with the growth in home value. After all, if income was not able to keep pace, then the rise in home value could actually be a detriment to communities because it makes the housing less affordable. We do this by charting Value/Income. For the most part, states have maintained or improved on this ratio; we can observe this by the flat to downward slope. This is especially apparent in the Northeastern part of U.S. On the other hand, the Western Part of the US which have seen significant increase in Home Value have actually deteriorated this ratio; we can observe this by the positive slope. This is especially apparent for States such as CA, NV, CO, etc. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component body { overflow: hidden; } .page { display: none; } .chart { width: 960px; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 0 auto; } .tooltip { position: absolute; content: attr(data-tooltip); text-align: left; min-width: 3em; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; padding: 15px 8px; border-radius: 3px; background: #F3F3F6; opacity: 0.6; color: #000000; z-index: 9999; -moz-box-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #888888; /* Firefox */ box-shadow: 3px 3px 5px #888888; } .range-slider-box { width: 90%; margin: 0 auto; } .title { text-align: center; margin: 10px; } .remark { position: absolute; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: -40px; font-size: 13px; text-align: left; padding: 10px 10px; padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); } Home Value by States (Year 2010-2019) "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
